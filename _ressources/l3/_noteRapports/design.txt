- adaptable to 
    - rows
    - columns
    - number of processors (can vary from 1 to 64, with no specific pattern)

- every matrix NxM (called the targetMatrix) has 0 borders on top and bottom.
    - relevant innerMatrix is [N-2, M-2]
    - values in the inner matrix are mirrored
    - partialMatrix (1/4 of inner matrix) is used as input calculations
    - table


design : required algorithms
    
    - allocate partialMatrix based on targetMatrix
    - mirror partialMatrix values to targetMatrix
        - needs to take into consideration what targetMatrix was
        - just because a partialMatrix is 6x2, doesn't mean the targetMatrix isn't odd
    - cpu to matrix assignment algo
        (based on the number of available CPUs, we need properly allocate the number of calculatable cells from our partialMatrix)
    - target matrix


____ OPENMPI VS MP
Unlike OpenMP, there is no "parallel region" to enclose, the entire code is a "parallel region", but nothing is shared.
